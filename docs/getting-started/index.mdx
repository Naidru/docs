### Reverse Proxies

Once you have installed SnailyCAD, you should setup a reverse proxy to access SnailyCAD via a domain name.
This is recommended to improve security and performance. We recommend NGINX but Apache is also an option. See the reverse proxy guides below:

- [**Cloudflare Tunnels**](/docs/installations/reverse-proxies/cf-tunnels)
- [**Windows NGINX** reverse proxy guide](/docs/installations/reverse-proxies/nginx-windows)
- [**Linux NGINX** reverse proxy guide](/docs/installations/reverse-proxies/nginx)

:::tip Reverse Proxy
This step is recommended for the most optimal performance and security. Cloudflare Tunnels is the easiest method to setup for most.
